The goal was to design flat panels with interlocking tabs and slots that could be laser-cut and assembled without fasteners or adhesives. This type of design is commonly used in digital fabrication for creating boxes, enclosures, and modular structures.</p> <p>The design process began by creating rectangular shapes to represent the box panels. Tabs were drawn and positioned along the edges of these panels, which would later interlock with slots on adjacent panels. Using Inkscape's Union tool (Path \u2192 Union), the base panels and tabs were merged into single, unified objects. This step was essential for creating clean geometry suitable for fabrication.</p> <p>Next, rectangular slots were created by drawing shapes at the appropriate positions and using the Difference tool (Path \u2192 Difference) to cut them out of the panels. The slot widths needed to match the material thickness to ensure a tight press-fit assembly. Careful attention was paid to the alignment and positioning of both tabs and slots to ensure the panels would fit together properly.

The objective was to design a functional board that controls an LED using a push button input and can be programmed via an ISP (In-System Programming) header. This activity bridged the gap between digital design and physical fabrication, emphasizing design-for-manufacturing principles specific to PCB milling.</p> <p>The circuit design centered around the ATtiny45, an 8-pin microcontroller running at 5V. The board includes an LED with a current-limiting resistor connected to one of the microcontroller's GPIO pins, a tactile push button for user input, a 6-pin ISP header for programming, and a power connector for external 5V supply. A decoupling capacitor was included between VCC and GND to ensure power stability, which is essential for reliable microcontroller operation. The design represents a complete microcontroller system rather than a simple demonstration circuit.</p> <p>The design process began in KiCad's schematic editor. Each component was placed and connected according to the circuit requirements. The ATtiny45 symbol served as the central component, with the LED and resistor forming the output circuit, the push button providing input functionality, and the ISP header enabling code uploads. All nets were labeled clearly to maintain organization and prevent connection errors. Particular attention was paid to the ISP header pinout, ensuring correct connections for MOSI, MISO, SCK, RESET, VCC, and GND, as incorrect wiring would prevent programming.</p> <p>After completing the schematic, footprints were assigned to each component. Through-hole (THT) components were selected to simplify hand soldering and make the board more beginner-friendly. The ATtiny45 used a DIP-8 footprint, the LED a standard 5mm THT footprint, and the resistor an axial through-hole package. The tactile button and headers also used through-hole footprints. This choice of footprints was deliberate, considering both fabrication constraints and assembly accessibility.</p> <p>The PCB layout phase presented the most significant design challenge due to the single-sided constraint. Unlike double-sided boards that can route traces on both top and bottom layers, this design required all copper traces to exist on a single layer. Components were arranged strategically to minimize trace crossings and reduce the need for jumper wires. The ISP header was positioned close to the ATtiny45 to keep programming traces short and direct. The LED was placed near the board edge for visibility, and the power connector was positioned for convenient access.</p> <p>Routing the board within the single-layer constraint required careful planning. Once a trace occupies a path, another trace cannot cross it, which became especially challenging in areas with many connections. Traces were kept as wide as practical to ensure they could be reliably milled without breaking. In situations where direct routing was impossible without crossing traces, the layout was adjusted by repositioning components or changing route paths. The routing process required multiple iterations to achieve a clean, manufacturable design.</p> <p>Design rule checking (DRC) was performed to verify the layout met manufacturing requirements. The DRC identified any unconnected nets, trace overlaps, or clearance violations that could cause fabrication or functional issues. All errors flagged by the DRC were resolved before proceeding to file generation. This step is critical in PCB design, as catching errors digitally is far easier than fixing them on a physical board.</p> <p>The final preparation involved adding identifying text to the board and exporting Gerber files and drill files. These files serve as the manufacturing instructions for the milling machine, defining where copper should be removed and where holes should be drilled. The design was reviewed in the 3D viewer to verify component placement and overall board aesthetics before export.</p> <p></p> <p>One of the primary learning outcomes from this activity was understanding that component placement is critical in single-sided PCB design. Good planning at the layout stage significantly reduces routing complexity. The challenge of working within single-sided constraints emphasized the importance of thinking ahead about fabrication requirements rather than simply connecting nets. This activity provided hands-on experience with the complete PCB design workflow, from schematic capture through layout and file generation.</p>"},{"location":"Daily-Activity/day_3/#download-files","title":"Download Files","text":"<p>Download KiCad Project Files (.zip)</p>"},{"location":"Daily-Activity/day_4/","title":"Day 4","text":""},{"location":"Daily-Activity/day_4/#day-4-materials-fabrication-methods","title":"Day 4 \u2013 Materials &amp; Fabrication Methods","text":""},{"location":"Daily-Activity/day_4/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Day 4 focused on understanding materials and their properties in relation to digital fabrication. The session covered material selection strategies, fabrication methods, and how material behavior affects the manufacturing process. This theoretical foundation is essential for making informed design decisions in subsequent practical activities.</p> <p>The day explored the relationship between material properties and fabrication outcomes. Different materials respond differently to various fabrication processes, and understanding these characteristics is crucial for successful digital manufacturing. The session examined common materials used in digital fabrication including wood, plastics, metals, and composites, discussing their strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications.</p> <p>Material selection is not simply about choosing what looks good or what is readily available. It involves considering mechanical properties such as strength, flexibility, and durability, as well as practical factors like cost, availability, and environmental impact. The fabrication method also influences material choice - a material suitable for laser cutting may not be appropriate for CNC milling or 3D printing.</p> <p>The concept of subtractive versus additive fabrication methods was explored in depth. Subtractive methods, such as CNC milling and laser cutting, remove material from a larger block or sheet to create the desired shape. Additive methods, like 3D printing, build up the object layer by layer. Each approach has distinct advantages and limitations, and the choice between them depends on factors including part geometry, material requirements, production volume, and budget constraints.</p> <p>Material behavior during fabrication is another critical consideration. Some materials may warp when heated, others may be brittle and prone to cracking, and some may require specific environmental conditions during processing. Understanding these behaviors helps designers anticipate potential issues and adjust their designs accordingly. For instance, accounting for material expansion or shrinkage, designing with appropriate tolerances, and selecting suitable fixturing methods all stem from understanding material behavior.</p> <p>Sustainability and material efficiency emerged as important themes. Digital fabrication enables more efficient use of materials compared to traditional manufacturing, but designers must still consider waste reduction, material recyclability, and lifecycle implications. Nesting parts efficiently on sheet materials, choosing renewable or recycled materials when possible, and designing for disassembly and recycling all contribute to more sustainable fabrication practices.</p> <p>Cost and durability considerations also play a significant role in material selection. While expensive materials may offer superior performance, they may not always be justified for every application. Similarly, designing for the appropriate lifespan - neither over-engineering nor under-engineering - requires understanding both material properties and the intended use case.</p> <p>This theoretical foundation prepared us for the hands-on fabrication activities in subsequent days, where material selection and understanding would directly impact the success of our projects.

The objective was to gain hands-on experience with the complete 3D printing workflow, from selecting and preparing a digital model to operating the printer and post-processing the finished part. This activity demonstrated how digital design translates into physical objects through layer-by-layer material deposition.</p> <p>The chosen design was a container lid sourced from Printables.com, an online repository of 3D printable models. Using pre-existing designs from such platforms is common practice in the maker community and provides an opportunity to study well-engineered models while learning the fabrication process. The lid design featured functional geometry including threading or fitting mechanisms that would need to interface with the base container component, making it a practical test of print accuracy and dimensional precision.</p> <p>The workflow began with downloading the STL file and importing it into slicing software. Slicing is the critical step where a 3D model is converted into machine instructions (G-code) that tell the printer exactly how to build each layer. During this process, several parameters needed to be configured including layer height, infill density, print speed, and support structures. The orientation of the part on the build plate was also considered, as this affects both the structural integrity of the final print and the amount of support material required.</p> <p>One significant challenge encountered during this process was selecting the correct printer profile in the slicing software. Initially, the wrong printer type was configured, which caused an error when attempting to send the print job to the machine. This error highlighted the importance of verifying machine settings before starting a print, as different printers have varying build volumes, nozzle configurations, and firmware requirements. The error was resolved by reconfiguring the slicer with the correct printer model and re-generating the G-code.</p> <p></p> <p>After resolving the configuration issue, the corrected G-code was loaded onto the printer. The machine was prepared by ensuring the build plate was level and clean, and that the filament was properly loaded and feeding smoothly. The print began with a first layer that required careful monitoring to ensure proper adhesion to the build plate, as first layer issues are a common cause of print failures. Once the first few layers were successfully deposited, the print continued with minimal intervention.</p> <p>The printing process itself took several hours, depending on the size and complexity of the lid design and the chosen layer height. Finer layers produce smoother surfaces but take longer to print, while thicker layers print faster but may show more visible layer lines. Throughout the print, the machine deposited material layer by layer, gradually building up the three-dimensional form from the bottom up. Support structures, if any were needed, were generated in areas where the geometry would otherwise print in mid-air.</p> <p>After the print completed, the part was removed from the build plate. Post-processing involved removing any support material and cleaning up the surface. Depending on the print quality and intended use, additional finishing steps such as sanding, filing, or chemical smoothing could be applied, though these were not strictly necessary for a functional prototype. The dimensional accuracy was checked to ensure the lid would fit properly with its corresponding container base.</p> <p></p> <p>This activity demonstrated several key concepts in additive manufacturing. Understanding how slicer settings affect both print quality and print time is essential for efficient 3D printing. The importance of proper machine configuration and error troubleshooting was reinforced through the printer selection issue. Additionally, working with a functional design that has specific dimensional requirements highlighted how 3D printing tolerances and material shrinkage must be considered during the digital preparation phase.</p> <p>The experience also illustrated the difference between designing for additive manufacturing versus other fabrication methods. Unlike subtractive processes that remove material, additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer, which introduces unique constraints such as the need for support structures, consideration of overhang angles, and awareness of how layer orientation affects strength.

This activity bridged the gap between digital design and physical production, demonstrating how computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) translates Gerber files into precise machine movements that create functional circuit boards. The process involved converting the ATtiny45 microcontroller board design into a milled PCB ready for component assembly.</p> <p>PCB milling is a subtractive fabrication process that removes copper from a copper-clad board to define circuit traces, pads, and other features. Unlike chemical etching methods that use corrosive solutions, mechanical milling uses precision cutting tools to carve away unwanted copper, leaving behind the desired circuit pattern. This approach offers several advantages for prototyping, including faster turnaround times, the ability to produce boards in-house without external manufacturers, and immediate iteration capabilities when design changes are needed.</p> <p>The milling process requires careful attention to several key parameters. Trace width determines both the current-carrying capacity of the circuit and the machinability of the design. Wider traces are more robust and easier to mill reliably, while very narrow traces may be fragile or difficult to produce consistently. Clearance between traces is critical for preventing short circuits and ensuring proper electrical isolation. Pads must be sized appropriately to support reliable soldering and provide mechanical stability for component leads. For single-sided boards, vias are typically avoided or replaced with wire jumpers during assembly, as through-hole plating is not available in basic milling processes.</p> <p>The workflow began by preparing the milling machine and loading the necessary software. Carbide Motion was used as the control software for interfacing with the CNC milling machine. The copper-clad board was secured to the machine bed using double-sided tape, ensuring it would remain firmly in place throughout the milling process. Proper board fixation is essential, as any movement during milling would result in misaligned traces or incomplete cuts.</p> <p>The Gerber files generated from KiCad during Day 3 were imported into Carbide Motion. These files contain all the geometric information needed to fabricate the board, including trace patterns, pad locations, drill holes, and board outline. The software processes these files and generates toolpaths that guide the milling machine's movements. Configuration of tool position and cutting depth was performed carefully, as incorrect settings could damage the board, break the milling bit, or produce inadequate results.</p> <p>One challenge encountered during the setup phase was achieving proper tool height calibration. The milling bit needs to be positioned precisely relative to the board surface to ensure it cuts through the copper layer without digging too deeply into the substrate material. Finding the correct zero point required careful adjustment and testing. Additionally, ensuring the board was completely flat and level on the bed was critical, as any warping or tilt would result in inconsistent cutting depth across the board.</p> <p>The milling process proceeded in stages. First, the machine engraved the circuit traces by removing copper from the areas between conductive paths. The cutting tool followed the programmed toolpaths, methodically carving away copper to isolate each trace, pad, and component footprint. This trace isolation step is the most critical phase, as it defines the actual circuitry. The machine worked systematically across the board, and the progress could be monitored to ensure proper execution.</p> <p>After trace milling was complete, the tool was changed to accommodate the board profiling operation. The profiling tool cuts the outer perimeter of the PCB, separating it from the larger copper-clad sheet. Tool position and depth were re-adjusted for this new operation, as cutting through the entire board thickness requires different settings than surface engraving. The machine then cut along the board outline, completing the physical fabrication of the PCB.</p> <p>The final milled board was removed from the machine bed and inspected for quality. The traces were clean and well-defined, with proper clearance between conductive paths. Holes for component leads were accurately positioned, and the board outline was cut cleanly. Minor burrs or rough edges from the milling process could be cleaned up with fine sandpaper or a deburring tool. The board was then ready for the next stage of assembly, which would involve soldering the ATtiny45 microcontroller, LED, resistor, push button, ISP header, and other components.</p> <p></p> <p>This activity demonstrated the complete transition from digital PCB design to physical fabrication. Understanding how design decisions in KiCad directly affect the milling process reinforced the importance of design-for-manufacturing principles. Working with the CNC milling machine provided hands-on experience with CAM workflows, toolpath generation, and the practical considerations of subtractive manufacturing. The challenges encountered, particularly around tool calibration and board fixation, highlighted the importance of careful setup and attention to detail in achieving reliable fabrication results.
