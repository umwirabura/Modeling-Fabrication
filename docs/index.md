# My documentation

Welcome to my digital fabrication and modeling documentation website.

This is a record of my learning process of the fabrication and modeling course provided by FABLAB and ACEIoT.


## About me

![](./images/KIRENGAOLIVIER_224020861.jpg){ width=200 align=right }

Hi! I am KIRENGA OLIVIER.
I am a Master`s student in IoT Embedded Computing Systems at the University of Rwanda African Center of Excellence. My primary interests lie in smart infrastructure, with a growing focus on integrating data-driven intelligence and secure system architectures into real-world applications.



## My background

I am originally from Rwanda and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Internet of Things, which I completed in China. My academic and professional experience spans embedded hardware–software integration, Android-based systems, and smart transportation technologies. I have worked on practical IoT solutions in industry settings, particularly in smart mobility and device-level system optimization, and I aim to deepen my expertise in building scalable, secure, and intelligent embedded systems during my master’s studies.
