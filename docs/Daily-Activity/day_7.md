## Day 7 – Digital Fabrication III: CNC Router Milling & Cutting

### PCB Milling Process

Day 7 focused on the physical fabrication of the PCB designed in Day 3 using a CNC milling machine. This activity bridged the gap between digital design and physical production, demonstrating how computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) translates Gerber files into precise machine movements that create functional circuit boards. The process involved converting the ATtiny45 microcontroller board design into a milled PCB ready for component assembly.

PCB milling is a subtractive fabrication process that removes copper from a copper-clad board to define circuit traces, pads, and other features. Unlike chemical etching methods that use corrosive solutions, mechanical milling uses precision cutting tools to carve away unwanted copper, leaving behind the desired circuit pattern. This approach offers several advantages for prototyping, including faster turnaround times, the ability to produce boards in-house without external manufacturers, and immediate iteration capabilities when design changes are needed.

The milling process requires careful attention to several key parameters. Trace width determines both the current-carrying capacity of the circuit and the machinability of the design. Wider traces are more robust and easier to mill reliably, while very narrow traces may be fragile or difficult to produce consistently. Clearance between traces is critical for preventing short circuits and ensuring proper electrical isolation. Pads must be sized appropriately to support reliable soldering and provide mechanical stability for component leads. For single-sided boards, vias are typically avoided or replaced with wire jumpers during assembly, as through-hole plating is not available in basic milling processes.

The workflow began by preparing the milling machine and loading the necessary software. Carbide Motion was used as the control software for interfacing with the CNC milling machine. The copper-clad board was secured to the machine bed using double-sided tape, ensuring it would remain firmly in place throughout the milling process. Proper board fixation is essential, as any movement during milling would result in misaligned traces or incomplete cuts.

The Gerber files generated from KiCad during Day 3 were imported into Carbide Motion. These files contain all the geometric information needed to fabricate the board, including trace patterns, pad locations, drill holes, and board outline. The software processes these files and generates toolpaths that guide the milling machine's movements. Configuration of tool position and cutting depth was performed carefully, as incorrect settings could damage the board, break the milling bit, or produce inadequate results.

One challenge encountered during the setup phase was achieving proper tool height calibration. The milling bit needs to be positioned precisely relative to the board surface to ensure it cuts through the copper layer without digging too deeply into the substrate material. Finding the correct zero point required careful adjustment and testing. Additionally, ensuring the board was completely flat and level on the bed was critical, as any warping or tilt would result in inconsistent cutting depth across the board.

The milling process proceeded in stages. First, the machine engraved the circuit traces by removing copper from the areas between conductive paths. The cutting tool followed the programmed toolpaths, methodically carving away copper to isolate each trace, pad, and component footprint. This trace isolation step is the most critical phase, as it defines the actual circuitry. The machine worked systematically across the board, and the progress could be monitored to ensure proper execution.

After trace milling was complete, the tool was changed to accommodate the board profiling operation. The profiling tool cuts the outer perimeter of the PCB, separating it from the larger copper-clad sheet. Tool position and depth were re-adjusted for this new operation, as cutting through the entire board thickness requires different settings than surface engraving. The machine then cut along the board outline, completing the physical fabrication of the PCB.

The final milled board was removed from the machine bed and inspected for quality. The traces were clean and well-defined, with proper clearance between conductive paths. Holes for component leads were accurately positioned, and the board outline was cut cleanly. Minor burrs or rough edges from the milling process could be cleaned up with fine sandpaper or a deburring tool. The board was then ready for the next stage of assembly, which would involve soldering the ATtiny45 microcontroller, LED, resistor, push button, ISP header, and other components.

This activity demonstrated the complete transition from digital PCB design to physical fabrication. Understanding how design decisions in KiCad directly affect the milling process reinforced the importance of design-for-manufacturing principles. Working with the CNC milling machine provided hands-on experience with CAM workflows, toolpath generation, and the practical considerations of subtractive manufacturing. The challenges encountered, particularly around tool calibration and board fixation, highlighted the importance of careful setup and attention to detail in achieving reliable fabrication results. The successful production of a functional PCB from the Day 3 design validated the entire design-to-fabrication workflow and prepared the board for final assembly and testing.

### Reflection

The PCB milling process revealed how digital design files are translated into physical manufacturing operations through precise machine control. The importance of proper setup, including tool height calibration and board fixation, became evident as critical factors in achieving successful results. Understanding the relationship between design parameters such as trace width and clearance, and their impact on machinability, reinforced the need to design with fabrication constraints in mind from the beginning. This hands-on experience with CNC milling complemented the theoretical knowledge from earlier days and provided practical insight into the capabilities and limitations of in-house PCB fabrication.
